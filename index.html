I acknowledge I didn’t read carefully enough before sending the message.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Read the channel topic & pinned messages to understand purpose.</li>
          <li>Check the last few messages for specific instructions or pinned notices.</li>
          <li>Introduce myself briefly (name, track, what I'm working on) only when appropriate.</li>
          <li>Use threads instead of posting directly to avoid disrupting discussions.</li>
          <li>Ask questions politely in existing threads if clarification is needed.</li>

            <p style="margin:0">Hello everyone — I sincerely apologize for sending a message directly into the channel instead of replying in a thread. I realize it was clearly stated that interns should avoid doing so, and I should have taken the time to read the existing messages before posting. I take full responsibility for the oversight and will make sure to follow all channel instructions carefully moving forward. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
